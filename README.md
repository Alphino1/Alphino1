Hello everyone,

This space is where I explore ideas in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how they connect with science and intelligence.

Right now, I am focused on open endedness, deep learning, and building systems that think algorithmically especially in the context of autonomous scientific discovery.

What keeps me going? Exploring and evolving AI that goes beyond just working: it actually makes sense. I am always learning and deepening my understanding.
.

I am here to learn, build, and work on ideas that matter.

Glad you stopped by: feel free to look around or reach out.
