Hey there, welcome!

This space reflects my curiosity and work in AI, machine learning, and quantitative reasoning, especially where they intersect with scientific discovery and intelligence.

Currently diving into: Machine learning, Deep learning, model interpretability, algorithmic thinking, and their applications in scientific discovery 

What drives me: Building AI systems that not only perform well but also make sense

Why I'm here: To learn, build, and collaborate on ideas that matter
