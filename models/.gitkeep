# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It is used to ensure that the 'models/' directory is versioned by Git,
# even if it is empty. You can remove this file once you add actual model files
# (e.g., .pkl, .h5) to this directory.
#
# Note: Large model files are often added to .gitignore. If you plan to do so,
# this .gitkeep file will still ensure the directory structure is present.
